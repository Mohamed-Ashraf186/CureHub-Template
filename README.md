# CureHub

CureHub is a healthcare management application designed to streamline the appointment scheduling process, patient management, and doctor scheduling. This project serves as a template for building scalable and maintainable healthcare applications using modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used

### 1. React

### 2. React Router

React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different components and views, allowing for a single-page application experience. With React Router, you can define routes and manage navigation seamlessly.

### 3. Styled Components

Styled Components is a library for styling React components using tagged template literals. It allows you to write CSS directly within your JavaScript, enabling scoped styles that are tied to specific components. This approach helps in maintaining styles in a modular way, avoiding global CSS conflicts.

### 4. shadcn

Shadcn is a design system that provides a set of components and utilities for building user interfaces in React applications. It emphasizes accessibility and customization, allowing developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

### 5. JSON

### 6. Other Libraries

- **Lucide React**: A collection of SVG icons for React, providing a wide range of icons to enhance the UI.
- **Radix UI**: A set of unstyled, accessible components for building high-quality design systems and web applications.
